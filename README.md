## Challenges

- Finding the exact colors used in the design prototype
- Certain icons & fonts was difficult to find the exact match. Evidently I went with available ones that's most similar to that of the design. 
- Distinct pattern in the background of the header could not be acheived within the timeframe without a design software.
